-Game created by Montblanc, images created by Daeleth, who doesn't watch the stream but give the man some credit, will ya?

This is a super basic text adventure game built entirely from scratch in javascript. Open up index.html in your browser to play it.

Everything's unminified javscript and obviously open source if you're paranoid about those scary computer viruses.

I tried to make a framework versitile enough to be rather open ended.

I failed, but at least the result's pretty stable.

This game does not have jumpscares.
